# BCXHackathonThreeSentimentAnalysis
You are provided with a dataset of 500,000 reviews. Each review has a user provided rating from 1 to 5. The task is to build a model that can accurately predict the rating given only the text. As this is an NLP task the contestant is permitted to use pretrained language models or word embeddings. The contestant is not however permitted to use other sentiment datasets.

An autograder was created for this hackathon, where the contestant's preprocessing pipeline is taken and applied directly to the hidden test data then fit to the contestant's model.
