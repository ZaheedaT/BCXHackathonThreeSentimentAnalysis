# BCXHackathonThreeSentimentAnalysis
You are provided with a dataset of 500,000 reviews. Each review has a user provided rating from 1 to 5. The task is to build a model that can accurately predict the rating given only the text. As this is an NLP task you are permitted to use pretrained language models or word embeddings. You are not however permitted to use other sentiment datasets.

We have created an autograder for this hackathon. We do not grade your submissions nor do we provide a test dataset. We take your preprocessing pipeline and apply it directly to the data then fit your model.
